                                maximum numbers of hours to work per week. This is 10 hours for a full
                                time PT working in lab sections, office hours and Piazza, but could be
                                more or less based on circumstances. If you are not sure what your hours
                                are or if you would like to change your semester schedule, notify Dr.
                                Leyk. If you are unable to make your lab or office hours in a given week
                                (i.e. career fair or interview) and need to reschedule them, also
                                notify the course professor and Dr. Leyk of this. <a

                            <li class="enumerate_item">Peer teaching is an hourly position. That
                                means you will be paid for actual hours worked, and not necessarily for
                                the maximum hours allocated. For example, if your are hired for “up to
                                10 hours per week,” but only work seven hours in a week, you can only
                                claim the seven hours. Claiming more hours than actually worked
                                constitutes fraud against the State of Texas and is a very serious
                                matter.</li>
                            <li class="enumerate_item">Actual hours you may work is ultimately
                                determined by need. If you plan to have a supplemental instruction
                                session every Wednesday night, but there are no students who need extra
                                help that week, cancel the session and notify the students and
                                professor. If you are not sure about how to handle the situation speak
                                with your professor and he or she will assist you or Dr. Leyk.</li>
                            <li class="enumerate_item">Making up hours: If you are not sure what
                                your hours are or if you would like to change your semester schedule,
                                notify Dr. Leyk. If you are unable to make your lab or office hours in a
                                given week (i.e. career fair, interview, sickness, etc.) and need to
                                reschedule them, also notify the course professor, the teaching
                                assistant(s) (TA) and Dr. Leyk of this.</li>
                            <li class="enumerate_item">Working more hours: If you on a regular basis
                                want to work more than 10 hours a week, this time needs to be approved
                                by the department head.</li>

                            <li class="enumerate_item">The primary duty of PTs is to help students
                                understand the material and skills taught in class and lab. This can be
                                done in a lab session, online through Piazza, or in supplemental
                                instruction sessions arranged between the professor, the PT and the
                                students.</li>
                            <li>PTs should support a professional demeanor:</li>

                                <li class="enumerate_item">Answer as many questions as you can.</li>
                                <li class="enumerate_item">Periodically ask around if there are any questions in the
                                    room.</li>
                                <li class="enumerate_item">Refrain from rude behavior and comments, especially regarding
                                    student performance.</li>
                                <li class="enumerate_item">Do not be distracted by your own work, reading, discussions,
                                    etc.</li>

                            <li class="enumerate_item">PTs should move around the room and help students without being
                                asked.</li>
                            <li class="enumerate_item">PTs should also be proactive in giving feedback to the professor
                                or TAs and filling out the biweekly survey online.</li>
                            <li>Helping students does not mean doing their programming or
                                assignments for them. Sometimes this is a difficult distinction. Here
                                are some hints for when the student has a problem:</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="enumerate" style="margin-left: 2em;">
                            <ul>
                                <li class="enumerate_item">Ask the student how he/she thinks the problem
                                    should be approached, then ask questions and make suggestions to guide
                                    the student to the right procedure.</li>
                                <li class="enumerate_item">Encourage students to read the assigned text
                                    outside of lab or tell them where to find practice problem or useful
                                    readings online.</li>
                                <li class="enumerate_item">Remember: sometimes it is clear that the
                                    student is completely lost or frustrated. In this situation, telling the
                                    student to read the book may not be helpful, so it would be better to
                                    explain and demonstrate a similar problem. Use your own judgment here.</li>
                                <li class="enumerate_item">Be supportive. Compliment students on what
                                    they do know or have done right before explaining what they need to
                                    learn or have done wrong.</li>
                                <li class="enumerate_item">When helping students with programming
                                    problems do not write the entire assignment for the student. It is much
                                    easier to show than to tell, but the student will have a hard time
                                    working independently if you do too much work for them. They will rely
                                    too much on you instead of making progress on their own.</li>
                                <li class="enumerate_item">If the professor or TA has not started a
                                    Piazza message board for the course, you should suggest that they do so.
                                    Remember to inform the students in the lab of Piazza.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="enumerate_item">If you are scheduled for office hours but
                                there is no one that needs your help, use this time to answer questions
                                or start discussions on assignments on Piazza.</li>
                            <li class="enumerate_item">Speak with your professor to make sure that
                                you understand what your duties include. PTs may be required to attend
                                regular planning meetings with the professor and/or TA or review
                                sessions. Remember that attendance at planning sessions and reviews are
                                part of your job and are paid hours, so be sure to include them on your
                                timesheets.</li>

                            <li class="enumerate_item">Remember that your timesheet must reflect the actual hours you
                                worked that week, not the hours you regularly work.</li>
                            <li class="enumerate_item">If you have questions, do not hesitate to ask.</li>
                            <li class="enumerate_item">PTs are required to complete a survey for
                                each pay period. This can be found online. The information entered is
                                automatically added to a spreadsheet for easy access. This system was
                                found to be an efficient and useful source for student information and
                                peer teacher accountability. The responses from this survey have been
                                provided to instructors of the courses monitored by the peer teaching
